I'm excited to share a project I've been working on that showcases my skills in web development and API integration. This project revolves around a dynamic platform designed to provide insightful player statistics effortlessly. Users can input a player's name and select a specific season, and the system taps into an API to retrieve and calculate average stats for that player. This project showcases my passion for both web development and sports analytics.
